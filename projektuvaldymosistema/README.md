# Project Managing system

This app was creating using javascript, react framework and node.js.
This app lets you create projects, add workers to projects, create tasks for workers, create deadlines for the tasks. Distribute tasks amongst workers.
There is a project file and worker file in json format which sort of simulate how the data woulde be fetched from a webserver.
The unique thing about this project is that project variables are stored in a doublylinkedlist and linkedlists.

This project was created to practice my react and web development skills and also implementing special data structures.
